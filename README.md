NeuralVisualizer
===============

NeuralVisualizer cooperates with TensorFlow and illustrates how a neural network works. It is capable of the following features.

- project data set into a 2D/3D positioning system with T-SNE.
- shows the process of training a neural network model.
- simulate how the input is processed within a neural network model.
